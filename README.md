# Excelsior
The GUI for machine learning.

Excelsior is a powerful one of a kind web application which allows the user to apply 
concepts of machine learning without a single line of coding. User can apply various machine 
learning algorithms on their own data using a well designed GUI.

Processing files and dimentionality reduction was never this easy before. With a few clicks
user can do the same. The processed file is stored in the back end automatically.
It can definitely be downloaded. But if the same file has to be used again, there is 
no need to re-upload.

Cassical machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and 
Decision Trees can be implemented with just a few clicks. The confusion matrix
and other results and graphs are plotted automatically after training.

The most important feature is the Neural Networks. Even deep nets can be trained using 
excelsior. There are no application which let you add layers in neural net with click of buttons.
Excelsior provides the best way to build neural nets and test your data.

## This is frontend. Run the backend first.

This application is the frontend that provides the user interface. All the calculations happens in the backend. So with out the backend running, this app will not work. So run the backend before starting this application. The backend runs on flask and python3. It is available as [ExcelsiorBee](https://github.com/subhasis-chand/ExcelsiorBee). Follow the instructions provided there to install the dependancies and start the backend. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
